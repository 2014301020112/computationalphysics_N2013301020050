# Shixing Wang's Repository for Computational Physics

## A Brief Introduction 简介

This repository is for the Computational Physics course by Prof. Cai from Wuhan University in the spring semester of 2016. Most algrithms will be realized by Python. Homeworks and other stuff I learn from this course will be included. Citing and revising of my codes are allowed based on the acknowledgement of my contribution. Giving advice and pointing out errors will be appreciated. You can contract me at wangshixing[at]whu.edu.cn
