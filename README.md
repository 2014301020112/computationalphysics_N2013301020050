## A Brief Introduction 简介

This repository is for the Computational Physics course by Prof. Cai from Wuhan University in the spring semester of 2016. Most algrithms will be realized by Python. Homeworks and other stuff I learn from this course will be included. Citing and revising of my codes are allowed based on the acknowledgement of my contribution. Giving advice and pointing out errors will be appreciated. You can contract me at wangshixing[at]whu.edu.cn

## Resources 资源




How to install Python 2.7.11 on Fedora 23 <br>

[如何在Fedora23中安装Python2.7.11](https://github.com/ShixingWang/computationalphysics_N2013301020050/blob/master/Resource/Fedora23.Python.2_7_11.md)




## VIM-written Section as part of Exercise 2




It is part of Exercise 2 to write the README.md file with VIM. So I added this section as a practice of the VIM editor and the git on Linux. Also the former "Changelog" section has been deleted. (It is  really a hard work to follow each change and update them in the Changelog... OTZ) And this is shown in [Exercise 2](https://github.com/ShixingWang/computationalphysics_N2013301020050/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise2.md) in the form of a screen shot.
