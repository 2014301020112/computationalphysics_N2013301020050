    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor is one of the most important output devices of computers[\\[1\\]](#jump1) and the graphic processing has been paid great attention in both hardware and software industry.[\\[2\\]](#jump2)[\\[3\\]](#jump3) In this exercise we managed to show the our name on the pixel lattice, and additionally, arbitrary charater strings. The highest level of this project is to show an animation on the screen. My project owns the advantage of the ability to changge lines if the string is too long, although failing to notice the usage of the dictionary prevents from showing punctions. [\\[4\\]](#jump4) And on the update on March 15, a dictionary got established to match the character the users input with the variables inside the program, enabling this project to show the punctuations and blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Although different monitors use various imaging materials like LCD, LED and so on, the rudiment of monitors is just a panel with million small pixels that can emit lights of various colors and various brightness, which involves discipines like vision perception that has little relation with this course. [\\[1\\]][cite1][\\[3\\]][cite3] To determine when and which color to show on the screen, the computer has to process large amount of calcuation simultaneusly, which led to the independence of GPU from CPU and the rapid advance of GPU since then.[\\[2\\]][cite2] In this exercise we simplify the monitor into a dot matrix by ignoring the color and brightness of pixels, showing patterns in a binary way of either blank or \"#\". \n",

    "\n",
    "This project shows briefly how our monitor works under the control of GPU. The meaningful code is not very long and I even think the hardest part is to tolerate the bore to design and input the list of the characters! \\_(:з」∠)_ The shining point, unmodestly speaking, is the ling changeing codes along with the `exec()` function. And this project elucidates how powerful list is in Python. Also as a novice of programming the control structures like `if` and `for` are good practices for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this process I failed to notice the convenience to use dictionary as the connection between what users input with our patterns. This is much more convenient for it circumvents the `exec()` function and the complex character computation inside it. Also, this has made great inconvience that users have to supplant \"\\_\" for blank, further preventing the project to expand to show the punctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After Update on March 15, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we hace realized the quoting of patterns from the user input through the dictionary, it is time for us to compare the pros and cons between list and dictionary. Dictionary, needless to say, make it possible to input the puctuations and numbers because the name of variables cannot be signs and pure numbers. Additionally, it make the input of blank much more natural. However, the old version exhibited the strong power of list and the function of internal function `exec()` to cope with chracter strings. After typing much more patterns of the punctuations and numbers, I even missed the old codes where we could do a little fewer tasks with much simpler codes!\n",

    "\n",
    "The code in this project is finished all by myself. But I have to devote appreciation to my friend and roommate Li Yao (2013301020048). It was him who offered the idea to use dictionary to correspond each character the user inputs with the pattern we design. \n",
