# Exercise 5: Problem 1.6 - Population Growth
[toc]
## Abstract     
A population growth problem is investigated about the linear birth rate and a quadratic death rate. Compared with the similar problem in the [previous exercise](), a new program finished in an object-oriented way is presented, in which the four steps a reader-friendly program should have are presented in a natural way as four internal functions of the class. Also the 3-D plotting is practiced with the importing of `visual` package.
